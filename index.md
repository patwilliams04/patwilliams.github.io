## Bio

I am an analytically-driven individual with a robust academic background in Physics and Economics, holding a BA and BS from Lehigh University as of 2023. My academic journey began with a deep passion for solving complex problems in AP Physics, which sparked my interest in applying as a Physics major. Opting against early graduation, I decided to pick up an Economics major which soon developed to pursuing the duel degree program. I accelerated my education by taking summer classes, completing the typical five-year program in four years. This rigorous academic schedule, however, limited my early professional experiences.

During my undergraduate studies, I discovered a passion for statistical analysis and big data through collaborative research with various faculty members in both the Physics and Economics departments. This exposure led to a keen interest in data science and analytics, prompting me to enroll in a multitude of programming-focused courses and engage in Python-based machine learning research in my final semester of my undergraduate studies. These experiences solidified my aspiration to embark on a career as an analyst, utilizing data to drive business decisions.

Prior to graduating, I was granted a full scholarship to pursue a Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics at Lehigh University. Applying to this program was motivated by my desire to refine my programming skills, particularly in Python, and deepen my financial knowledge. This advanced degree was a strategic step towards achieving my career objectives, that being to enter the field of finance in a data driven role. 

During the summer following my graduation, I undertook an internship at a financial institution, where I  engaged in leveraging machine learning and AI to automate current financial processes. As part of this role, I initiated a side project to integrate data science techniques within finance in the realm of M&A activity, which not only enhanced my workforce experience but also laid the groundwork for further development of this project both in my academic studies and professional future. Further steps taken towards this project development are specified under 'M&A Project'.

As I prepare to rejoin the same financial institution this summer, I am eager to utilize my refined programming skills and enhanced knowledge in finance and to continue to contribute effectively and grow within the corporate world.

I am very interested in any opportunities that will allow me to continue developing my technical skills and financial literacy while contributing towards innovative and strategic projects. I enjoy continuous learning and seek to be in an environment where I can grow both as an individual but also as a team with those around me. 

I welcome your insights on the best pathways for advancing my career in the field of finance and data science, and I am eager to explore opportunities that align with my experience and educational background.
